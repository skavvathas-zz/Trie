# Trie
An english dictionary implement via a compressed Trie

### The input
The HW1.java file contains the main().
The program reads from stdin the input-operation we want the program to do.
We have:  
```
  -i word   -->   import word in the Trie  
```
```
  -r word   -->   remove word from the Trie 
```
```
  -f word   -->   find word in the Trie  
```
```
  -p        -->   prints (pre-order) the Trie  
```
```
  -d        -->   prints all the words in Trie, with alphabetic order 
```
```
  -w word X   -->   search in the Trie all the words, that is different X letters from word  
```
```
  -s suffix   -->   search in the Trie all the words with suffix   
```
```
  -q        --> quit the program  
```
